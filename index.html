                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>Developing meaningful research questions can open so many doors. 
                    To understand holistic experiences, and what might be associated 
                    with them to help better articulate the message of the end goal. Like knowing what users are looking for when they are searching for a “modern” website, and knowing that word is often associated with simplicity and functionality.

                <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                <p>Empathy is such a hard thing to pin down, and therefore needs to be revisited at every opportunity. By creating affinity diagrams and empathy maps before stating user insights so that user understanding can be truly discerned. 
                    But then testing and 
                    asking more questions to understand if what is being created is easy and useful. Because empathy will best help designers make a positive helpful impact on the lives of others

                <h3>Qualitative Interviews</h3>
                <p>Empathy can be so helpful in understanding experiences and ideas. But qualitative data helps point out the big picture so well. Because actions can sometimes trump words, and seeing qualitative data is like putting the icing on the cake. Knowing that qualitatively users are spending little time on menus and actions, and more on digesting content through heatmaps and testing through sites like Maze, apps are able to go further than simply looking good to actually doing good.
